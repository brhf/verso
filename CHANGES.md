  * Previously, when opening a file in a format that cannot be rendered, Verso
    would crash. Now it displays a dummy icon instead but still allows to edit
    the file's metadata. That's useful for example to edit XMP metadata of an
    MP4 video.

# Release 1.0.0

2017-07-31

  * Initial release.
